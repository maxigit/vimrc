" Vim syntax support file

" This file sets up the default methods for highlighting.
" It is loaded from "synload.vim" and from Vim for ":syntax reset".
" Also used from init_highlight().

if !exists("syntax_cmd") || syntax_cmd == "on"
  " ":syntax on" works like in Vim 5.7: set colors but keep links
  command -nargs=* SynColor hi <args>
  command -nargs=* SynLink hi link <args>
else
  if syntax_cmd == "enable"
    " ":syntax enable" keeps any existing colors
    command -nargs=* SynColor hi def <args>
    command -nargs=* SynLink hi def link <args>
  elseif syntax_cmd == "reset"
    " ":syntax reset" resets all colors to the default
    command -nargs=* SynColor hi <args>
    command -nargs=* SynLink hi! link <args>
  else
    " User defined syncolor file has already set the colors.
    finish
  endif
endif

" Many terminals can only use six different colors (plus black and white).
" Therefore the number of colors used is kept low. It doesn't look nice with
" too many colors anyway.
" Careful with "cterm=bold", it changes the color to bright for some terminals.
" There are two sets of defaults: for a dark and a light background.
