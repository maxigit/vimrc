unbundle.vim - Activates [bundles] found in Vim's runtimepath
=============================================================

Ubundle is a short alternative to [Pathogen]'s bundle isolation, registration,
and helptag facilities.  It also features **ftbundles**: Vim filetype specific
bundles that are automatically loaded on demand for improved Vim performance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unbundle looks for directories called `bundle/` in Vim's runtimepath and then
adds all subdirectories therein back into Vim's runtimepath.  This lets you
keep your [bundles] isolated in their own directories, instead of having to
share your Vim runtime directory communally with your [bundles].

### ftbundles - filetype specific bundles

Unbundle also looks for directories called `ftbundle/` in Vim's runtimepath.
These directories contain subdirectories whose names reflect Vim filetypes.
These subdirectories contain bundles that are only loaded when Vim demands it.

For example, if you have 5 bundles that concern the `ruby` filetype, then you
would place those bundles in `ftbundle/ruby/` to only load them when you edit
a Ruby file.  This reduces Vim's startup time, especially if your I/O is slow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Clone this Git repository or [download its contents][download] into a new
   `bundle/vim-unbundle` subdirectory inside your Vim runtime directory.  For
   example, `~/.vim/bundle/vim-unbundle` would be the corect location in Unix.

2. Run the following command inside Vim to start using Unbundle immediately,
   or add it to your `vimrc` file to start Unbundle whenever you start Vim.

        runtime bundle/vim-unbundle/unbundle.vim

  idea](https://github.com/sunaku/vim-unbundle/issues/2).

* [Peter Aronoff](http://ithaca.arpinum.org) gave feedback and ideas on how to
  best organize filetypes with dependent ftbundles, such as eRuby templates.

  appending `/.` to directory globs for portability across operating systems.
